    <h3>Intrusion Detection System & Data Analysis and Visualisation (Python) (University)</h3>
    <a href = "https://github.com/Aifert/CITS2401-Project">Intrusion Detection System & Data Analysis</a>
    <h4>Developer</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            A Python program that can scan through millions of data and estimate the porportion of abnormality in given data.
        </li>
        <li>
            Due to the size of data given, going through eac hone will take too much resources, hence the program
            is designed to estimate the proportion only.
        </li>
        <li>
            The second part is then to visualise how well our estimation did compared to actual intrusion ratio.
        </li>
        <li>
            Finally generating a report on the F1 Score, accuracy, precision and recall while also giving us
            the best standard deviation with respect to the mean time stamp to analyse the data with.

        </li>
        <li>
            Also added some buttons that can make the bot generate a random integer, send a rick roll youtube video.

            connected components in the graphs amd the centre of a graph, a vertex with its maximum shortest path from that vertex
            to any other is the minimum possible.
