                <p>Hi, thank you for visiting my page. My name is Aifert Yet and welcome to my world.
                I am currently undertaking my 3rd year of Software Engineering (Honours) at the University of Western Australia.</p>
                <p> Coming from a non-tech background, ever since interacting with technology, I fell deep in love with 
                    technology communicate with each other, how they are displayed to us and how I can change every aspect of that.
                </p>
                <p>Though, I must say technology is not easy to understand. I remember telling my friends around me that humans are insanely
                    intellegent to come up with something called the internet. I still think that till this day. But that is the core reason for my 
                    my love for technology. The infinite challenges and ways that I can cooperate with a team to solve a problem and call myself intellegent too.
                </p>
                <p>There are a lot of things I enjoy doing and here is a list of 3 of them.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>Watching people train AI models.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Playing video games.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Coding.</p></li>
                </ul>
                <br/>
                <p>A quote I live by : </p>
                <p class="mt-3">The journey is never ending. There's always gonna be growth, improvement, adversity;
                you just gotta take it all in and do what's right, continue to grow, continue to live in the moment. - 
                Antonio Brown.
                </p>
